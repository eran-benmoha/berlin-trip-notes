## Practical tips

- **February weather**: Expect **0–5 °C**, possibly gray or drizzly. Dress in warm layers + waterproof jacket. Sanssouci Park paths can be muddy — sturdy shoes recommended.
- **Sanssouci Palace interior**: In winter (Nov–Mar), the palace is open **only Tue–Sun** and often only with **guided tours at set times**. Check [spsg.de](https://www.spsg.de/en/) the day before. The park itself is always open.
- **Cash**: Some smaller Potsdam shops and cafés are cash-only. Bring some euros.
- **Duration**: Potsdam is compact. You can see the highlights in a half-day, but a full day lets you enjoy it without rushing.
- **WelcomeCard discount**: If you have the Berlin WelcomeCard, it gives up to **50% off** at Sanssouci Palace and other SPSG palaces — show it at the ticket counter.
