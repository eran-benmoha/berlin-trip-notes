# Packing — Berlin (February)

## Weather context
- **Forecast**: -6°C to 10°C across the trip. Snow/rain on some days.
- **Coming from Israel this will feel extreme.** A typical Tel Aviv February is 12–18°C. Berlin will be 15–25 degrees colder. Your body isn't used to this — pack accordingly.
- The cold isn't just temperature — it's **wind chill** and **damp air** that cuts through thin layers. You'll be walking 15,000+ steps per day outdoors.

## Documents + entry

### Visa / entry requirements (Israel → Germany)
- [ ] **Passport** — must be valid for at least 3 months beyond your travel dates. Check expiry now.
- [ ] **Visa**: Israeli passport holders get **visa-free entry to the Schengen zone for up to 90 days**. No visa needed for this trip.
- [ ] **ETIAS**: As of 2025, the EU's ETIAS travel authorization system may apply. Check [travel-europe.europa.eu/etias](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/etias_en) before you go — it's a quick online form (~€7) if required.
- [ ] **Travel insurance** — strongly recommended. Keep a digital copy + screenshot on your phone. Some credit cards include coverage — check yours.
- [ ] **European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)**: Not applicable for Israeli citizens. Make sure your travel insurance covers medical.

### Money
- [ ] **Wallet + cards** — Visa/Mastercard with contactless (Apple Pay / Google Pay work widely). Amex is rarely accepted.
- [ ] **Some cash (€)** — withdraw at the airport or an ATM in Berlin. Many smaller Berlin shops, cafés, and market stalls are **cash-only** (more than you'd expect). Bring at least **€100–150 in cash** to start.
- [ ] **Notify your bank** that you're traveling to Germany so cards don't get blocked.

### Copies & digital backups
- [ ] Screenshot or PDF of flight confirmations on phone
- [ ] Screenshot of lodging address + check-in instructions
- [ ] Screenshot of walking tour booking confirmations
- [ ] Photo of passport info page (on phone + cloud)

## Clothing — this is where Israelis underpack

> **The #1 mistake**: bringing a "warm" jacket that's fine for a Jerusalem winter but useless in -5°C Berlin wind. You need real cold-weather gear.

### Outerwear (most important)
- [ ] **Heavy winter coat** — a proper insulated puffer or wool coat, not a light windbreaker. It should be **windproof** and ideally **water-resistant**. If you don't own one, buy in Berlin at Uniqlo (already in your itinerary on 19.2) or Decathlon.
- [ ] **Waterproof layer or rain jacket** — for the rainy days (21.2, 22.2). A compact packable rain jacket is ideal. Alternatively, a good umbrella.

### Layering system (key concept: trap warm air between layers)
- [ ] **Thermal base layer (top + bottom)** — Uniqlo Heattech or similar. Wear under your clothes. This is what keeps you warm, not just the coat. **2 sets recommended** so one can air out.
- [ ] **Fleece or wool sweater** — mid-layer over the thermal. 2 is enough.
- [ ] **Long-sleeve shirts / turtlenecks** — 2–3 for layering.
- [ ] **Regular t-shirts** — 2–3 (for indoors / sleeping).

### Bottoms
- [ ] **Warm trousers** — jeans alone are NOT enough in -5°C. Bring thick trousers or lined pants. Thermal leggings underneath jeans also works.
- [ ] **Thermal leggings / long underwear** — wear under your pants on cold days. This makes a huge difference.

### Feet — critical
- [ ] **Warm waterproof shoes/boots** — you'll walk 15–20 km per day. Shoes must be: (1) warm, (2) waterproof or water-resistant (Sanssouci Park will be muddy), (3) comfortable for all-day walking. Sneakers alone won't cut it.
- [ ] **Thick wool or thermal socks** — 3–4 pairs. Regular cotton socks will leave your feet freezing. Wool socks are a game-changer.
- [ ] **Extra regular socks** — 2–3 pairs as backup.

### Head, hands, neck — where you lose heat fastest
- [ ] **Warm hat / beanie** — covers ears. Essential, not optional.
- [ ] **Gloves** — insulated, touchscreen-compatible if possible (so you can use your phone for maps without freezing your hands).
- [ ] **Scarf or neck gaiter** — protects your neck and can pull up over your face in wind.

### Other clothing
- [ ] **Underwear** — 5 days' worth.
- [ ] **One "nicer" outfit** — for KaDeWe / Faustus Schnitzelhaus / Monsieur Vuong dinners. Doesn't need to be fancy, just not full outdoor hiking gear.
- [ ] **Sleepwear** — apartments can vary in heating.

## Tech
- [ ] **Phone + charger cable (USB-C)**
- [ ] **Lightning cable** (for any Lightning devices)
- [ ] **Power bank + cable** — long days out, you'll use maps + camera constantly.
- [ ] **EU plug adapter (Type C/F)** — Israel uses Type H plugs. **You need an adapter.** Buy one before you go or at BER airport.
- [ ] **Headphones** — for flights, transit, podcasts.
- [ ] **Offline maps** — download Berlin + Potsdam in Google Maps for offline use (saves battery + works in U-Bahn underground).

---

## Health & comfort
- [ ] **Any prescription meds** + a few days' extra supply
- [ ] **Painkillers** (Advil / paracetamol)
- [ ] **Blister plasters** (Compeed or similar) — you'll walk a lot, new/stiff shoes cause blisters
- [ ] **Lip balm with SPF** — cold dry air chaps lips fast
- [ ] **Moisturizer / hand cream** — dry cold air + indoor heating = cracked skin. Not something you deal with in Israel.
- [ ] **Hand sanitizer**
- [ ] **Tissues / small pack of wet wipes**
- [ ] **Sunscreen** — yes, even in winter. Snow reflects UV. Light SPF for face if you'll be at Sanssouci Park all day.

---

## Day bag (what to carry daily)
- [ ] **Small backpack or crossbody bag** — big enough for a water bottle, extra layer, umbrella, power bank.
- [ ] **Water bottle** (refillable) — Berlin tap water is safe and good.
- [ ] **Compact umbrella**
- [ ] **Reusable tote bag** — for Mauerpark flea market, Uniqlo shopping, etc. German shops charge for bags.

## Things you can buy in Berlin (don't stress if you forget)
- **Thermals / Heattech**: Uniqlo at Alexanderplatz (19.2 itinerary)
- **Warm socks / gloves / hat**: any H&M, Primark, or Decathlon
- **EU plug adapter**: any electronics store, airport, or even some supermarkets
- **Toiletries**: DM or Rossmann drugstores are everywhere and cheap
- **Cash withdrawal**: ATMs (Geldautomat) are everywhere. Use bank ATMs, avoid "Euronet" ones (high fees).
