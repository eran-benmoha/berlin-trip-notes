## Weather vs. itinerary — concerns

| Day | Plan | Outdoor exposure | Weather fit |
|---|---|---|---|
| **18.2** | Wall Memorial + walking tour + Brandenburg Gate | Medium (walking tour is 2.5 hrs outdoor) | OK — clears by afternoon, dress very warm |
| **19.2** | Museum Island + Hackesche Höfe + KaDeWe | Low–medium (museums are indoor, walks between) | **Great** — driest day, perfect for Mitte walking |
| **20.2** | Topography of Terror + East Side Gallery + RAW | Medium–high (East Side Gallery is fully outdoor) | OK — dry but **-5°C morning**, dress in layers, warmest at 0°C |
| **21.2** | **Wannsee + Potsdam (Sanssouci Park)** | **High** (park is the main draw) | **Poor** — rain/snow, 60% precip, muddy paths. Consider swapping days. |
| **22.2** | Mauerpark + Charlottenburg museums | Medium (flea market is outdoor, museums indoor) | Mixed — morning might be dry, rain from ~15:00. Museums are fine. |

### Recommendation

**21.2 (Potsdam) is the biggest concern.** Sanssouci Park — the highlight — is fully outdoor and paths get muddy in rain. Options:

1. **Swap days**: Move Potsdam to **20.2 (Thu)** which is dry and clear. Move Wall/Kreuzberg to **21.2 (Sat)** — rain matters less since Topography of Terror is mostly indoor, and RAW-Gelände has covered areas.
2. **Keep as-is but adjust**: Shorten Sanssouci Park, focus on the Wannsee Conference House (indoor, excellent) and Dutch Quarter cafés (sheltered). Bring waterproof layers.
3. **Decide on the day**: Check the forecast again on 19.2 — if 21.2 still looks wet, do the swap.
